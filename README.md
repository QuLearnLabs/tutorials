## Package requirements
Before we can begin, you will need to install the following Python packages to use the notebooks:
- `qiskit`
- `matplotlib`
- `pylatexenc`
- `jupyter`

Recall that the command to install Python packages is `pip install <package_name>`.
Always use a virtual environment when possible!
